# Car Directory Application
This is an application that was made for my final project of iOS Development #1 completed in the Fall of 2021. The application was built in UIkit. This application parses a car directory database and displays them using UITableView. It also includes a detail view of the selected cell. Also implements a Tab view that displays a small bio and picture.

This project implements: 
* Parsing JSON
* UITableViewController
* Tab View Controller
